1. **Assignment 1: Variable Declarations**
   - Create a JavaScript file.
   - Declare three variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
   - Try to reassign values to each of them and observe the results.
   - Write comments explaining the behavior.

2. **Assignment 2: Scope of Variables**
   - Create a JavaScript file.
   - Declare a variable with `var` inside a function and try to access it outside the function.
   - Declare a variable with `let` inside a block (e.g., an `if` statement) and try to access it outside the block.
   - Write comments explaining the scope of each variable.

3. **Assignment 3: Hoisting**
   - Create a JavaScript file.
   - Write code that demonstrates variable hoisting with `var`.
   - Write similar code to demonstrate the behavior of `let` and `const` in terms of hoisting.
   - Explain the output in comments.
