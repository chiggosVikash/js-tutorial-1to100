# JavaScript Variables

## Introduction
Variables in JavaScript are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in your code. Understanding how to declare and use variables is fundamental to working with JavaScript.

## Types of Variable Declarations

### `var`
- **Scope**: Function-scoped or globally-scoped if declared outside a function.
- **Characteristics**: Can be re-declared and updated. Hoisted to the top of their scope, but initialized with `undefined`.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  var name = 'John';
  ```

### `let`
- **Scope**: Block-scoped.
- **Characteristics**: Can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope. Not hoisted like `var`.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let age = 30;
  ```

### `const`
- **Scope**: Block-scoped.
- **Characteristics**: Cannot be updated or re-declared; must be initialized at the time of declaration.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const isStudent = true;
  ```

## Data Types

### Primitive Data Types
- **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
  ```javascript
  let count = 10;
  ```
- **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.
  ```javascript
  let greeting = 'Hello';
  ```
- **Boolean**: Represents `true` or `false`.
  ```javascript
  let isActive = false;
  ```
- **Null**: Represents an intentional absence of value.
  ```javascript
  let emptyValue = null;
  ```
- **Undefined**: Represents an uninitialized variable.
  ```javascript
  let notAssigned;
  ```

### Composite Data Types
- **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
  ```javascript
  let person = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
  ```
- **Array**: Represents an ordered list of values.
  ```javascript
  let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  ```
- **Function**: Represents a block of code designed to perform a task.
  ```javascript
  function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  }
  ```

### Special Data Types
- **BigInt**: Represents integers with arbitrary precision.
  ```javascript
  let largeNumber = 12345678901234567890n;
  ```
